# Stage 7.3: Exchange Status Localization

This stage addresses a regression/gap in the UI renaming effort where the Exchange Status message (generated by the backend) still referred to players as "P1", "P2", etc.

## 1. Issue
The backend sends strings like `"P1 changed 2 cards → P2 exchanging..."`. The frontend was displaying this raw string, bypassing the new name mapping logic.

## 2. Fix
- **Component**: `PhasePanel.vue`
- **Logic**: Implemented a computed property `formattedExchangeStatus` that uses a Regex replacement (`/P(\d+)/g`) to parse the backend string.
- **Mapping**: It looks up the parsed index using the Pinia store's `getPlayerName(index)` getter.

## 3. Result
The UI now consistently displays names (e.g., "Mike changed 2 cards") throughout the entire game lifecycle, including the exchange log.
